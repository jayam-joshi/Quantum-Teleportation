# Quantum-Teleportation
An algorithm to transfer quantum information from a sender to reciever using the concept of superposition and entanglement.
There exists a theorem in quantum mechanics which states that you cannot simply make an exact copy of an unknown quantum state. This is known as the no-cloning theorem.Thus a quantum circuit is designed so as to transfer the state |ψ⟩ from sender to reciever.
